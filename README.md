> This is a side project which is moving at a very slow pace.
> There are currently no enhancements compared to the [upstream project](https://github.com/riskeco/Samsung-FRP-Bypass)

> [!Warning]
> This has been tested with many Android 13 Devices. However I haven't had much luck with anything newer.
